# HullRaspJam_Workshops
Scribus files and artefacts for the workshop handouts for HullRaspJam

If you want to edit or create new files from the Scribus Worksheet-Master.sla file in the Master directory, first install all the 
fonts. The Scribus master file has master pages for each worksheet type and the various elements for both standard and visually 
impaired worksheets are in the Scribus clipboard for the Worksheet-Master.sla.

The different styles for each block type are also defined, so you can quite easily change from standard to visually impaired 
document format. I have added a background rectangle of the Jam Yellow colour at 25% for the visually impaired background.

The graphic elements for the Scratch blocks are generated from the amazing Scratch Blocks website: https://scratchblocks.github.io/ 

Some of the worksheets I have now been making in Google Docs (as it is so much quicker!). I have linked those below; feel free to take copies and adapt...
