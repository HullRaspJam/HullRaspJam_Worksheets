This folder contains the various fonts used in the HullRaspJam worksheets. Install them all before opening the Scribus files. You will also need the Arial font installed. This should be available by default on Windows PCs and can be installed on Debian / Ubuntu machines by running "sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer"
